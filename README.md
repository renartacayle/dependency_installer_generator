# dependency_installer_generator
Description
The script dependency_installer_generator.py is a utility designed to analyze JavaScript and Python code files within a specified directory. It scans the files for import statements, extracts the names of the imported modules, and generates installation commands for those modules. The generated commands can be used to install the necessary dependencies using npm for JavaScript and pip for Python. This tool is particularly useful for developers who want to quickly gather and install all dependencies required for a project.

Features
Cross-Language Support: The script can process both JavaScript (.js) and Python (.py) files.
Import Extraction: It uses regular expressions to find and extract import statements from the code files.
Command Generation: Automatically generates installation commands for the identified imports.
Exclusion of Paths: Users can specify directories to exclude from the search, allowing for more targeted analysis.
Output to File: The generated installation commands are saved to a specified text file for easy access.
How to Use
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This script is compatible with Python 3.x.

Save the Script: Copy the code into a file named (Name desire).py.

Run the Script:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where import_finder.py is saved.
Run the script using the following command:

python (Name desire).py

Input Prompts:

Root Directory: When prompted, enter the path to the root directory containing your JavaScript and Python code files. The script will search for files in this directory and its subdirectories.
Exclude Paths: You will be asked to enter any paths you want to exclude from the search. Enter these as a comma-separated list (e.g., node_modules,venv).
Output Directory: Finally, specify the directory where you want to save the generated installation commands.
Check the Output: After the script completes, check the specified output directory for a file named install_commands.txt. This file will contain the installation commands for the identified imports.

Example Usage

python (Name desire).py


Input Example:


Enter the path to the root directory containing code files: /path/to/your/project

Enter paths to exclude (comma-separated): node_modules,venv

Enter the directory to save the installer commands: /path/to/output

Output: The script will create a file named install_commands.txt in the specified output directory, containing commands like:

"
npm install express
pip install requests
"

Notes
Ensure that the paths you provide are valid and accessible.
The script uses regular expressions to identify import statements, so it may not capture all edge cases. Review the output to ensure all necessary dependencies are included.
You can modify the script to add support for additional languages or customize the import patterns as needed.
